# 🐍 Snake_case to CamelCase Converter 🚀

## 📌 Overview

This is a simple JavaScript project that converts user-inputted **snake_case** text into **camelCase** format. The program takes multiple lines of input, processes each one, and outputs the transformed text with a ✅ indicator based on its line position.

The project demonstrates JavaScript string manipulation, DOM interaction, and event-driven programming.

## ✨ Features

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. The user enters **snake_case** formatted text into a `<textarea>`.
2. Clicking the **Convert** button triggers the conversion function.
3. Each valid line is transformed into `camelCase` and displayed in the **console**.
